# Staker Agora: Explorer for the StakerDAO proposal process

StakerDAO is a platform for governing financial assets in a decentralized, secure, 
and compliant manner.  The Staker Agora governance process is designed to allow the 
decentralized governance of a growing set of assets that are managed by the STKR 
token holder community.
